# L-LUT-to-P-LUT-Synthesis
(WIP) A Python + SystemVerilog toolflow that converts large Boolean truth tables (L-LUTs) into FPGA-ready 6-input LUT (P-LUT) networks using different decomposition methods. Compares methods using metrics such as LUT count, unique LUTs, depth and Vivado-based area/timing evaluation.
